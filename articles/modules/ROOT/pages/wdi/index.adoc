= Web Data Integration

The Web is the largest repository of data in the known history of the universe.

It is clear from the definition of Data Integration, that if you view the World Wide Web as a data source, or indeed as many different data sources, the ability to bring the data together from different parts of the web into a single datastore is an extension of the Data Integration problem. 

Here the data is heteregenously available, and needs to be homogenised and consolidated in order to be leveraged.
